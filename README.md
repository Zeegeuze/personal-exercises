# Portfolio
In order to be prepared for a future in DataScience, I decided to start with a portfolio already.
In January 2024 I started a bootcamp with Le Wagon in 'Data Science and AI'.

## Job hunt
### Intro
The first project I'm working on is a fun way to check where to work in the future. 
It's mainly meant as an exercise in Jupyter Notebook, Python and working with online maps.
So don't be surprised if I end up applying for something / wherewhere totally different.

### What I did
I used the following programs: notebook, Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium
I scraped, saved as and uploaded CSV, created maps, heatmaps and plots, added non-existing data to a geoframe,
rescaled features, cleaned data and finished with putting the main elements in slides.
