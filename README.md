# Portfolio
In order to be prepared for a future in DataScience, I decided to start with a portfolio already.
In January 2024 I started a bootcamp with Le Wagon in 'Data Science and AI'.

## Jobs hunt
The first project I'm working on is a fun way to check where to work in the future. 
It's mainly meant as an exercise in Jupyter Notebook, Python and working with online maps.
So don't be surprised if I end up applying for something / wherewhere totally different.
